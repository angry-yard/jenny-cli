# Installation
## Global Installation
The package should be installed globall with NPM like

```bash
npm install -g jenny
```

This will allow for jenny to be run with less arguments and from any direction as you will have 
multiple projects and therefore will not need to reinstall jenny.

## Local Installation
However it can be installed as a local module

```bash
npm install jenny
```

All code examples will assume jenny was installed globally
